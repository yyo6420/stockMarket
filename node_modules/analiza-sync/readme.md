# analiza-sync

A tiny helper that provides a **synchronous** `input()` function for Node.js, similar to Python's built-in `input()`.

Designed for teaching and simple CLI exercises, so students can write:

```js
const name = input('Name: ');
console.log('Hello,', name);
````

without dealing with async/await, streams or callbacks.

> ⚠️ This library is **blocking** by design. It is intended for small CLI programs and exams, not for servers.

---

## Installation

```bash
npm install analiza-sync
```

---

## Usage

### ES Modules (recommended)

```js
import input from 'analiza-sync';

const name = input('Name: ');
const age = input('Age: ');

console.log(`Hello ${name}, you are ${age} years old.`);
```

### CommonJS (Node 18+ with `createRequire`)

```js
import { createRequire } from 'node:module';
const require = createRequire(import.meta.url);

const input = require('analiza-sync').default;

const name = input('Name: ');
console.log('Hi', name);
```

## API

### `input(prompt?: string): string`

* `prompt` (optional) – text to print before waiting for input.
* Returns: the line the user typed, **without** the trailing newline.

Behavior:

* Prints the prompt without a newline (like Python’s `input()`).
* Blocks the Node.js event loop until the user types a line and presses **Enter**.
* Strips the ending `\n` (and `\r` on Windows) from the result.
* Returns an empty string if the user just presses Enter.

---

## How it works (high level)

Internally, this library:

* Writes the prompt using `fs.writeSync(1, prompt)` → **stdout** (file descriptor `1`).
* Allocates a 1-byte `Buffer`.
* Repeatedly calls `fs.readSync(0, buffer, 0, 1, null)` → **stdin** (file descriptor `0`).
* Converts each byte to a character and appends it to a string.
* Stops reading when it sees a newline (`'\n'`), ignoring carriage returns (`'\r'`).

This is intentionally **blocking** and simple, to mirror the mental model of Python’s `input()` and make it easier for students to focus on the programming task rather than on Node’s async primitives.

---

## When should you (not) use this?

✅ Good for:

* Teaching basic programming concepts in Node.js.
* Small CLI exercises and exams.
* Quick scripts where blocking is acceptable.

🚫 Not recommended for:

* HTTP servers / long-running services.
* Applications that depend on non-blocking I/O and high concurrency.
